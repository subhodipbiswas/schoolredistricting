# Spatial Optimization techniques for School Redistricting

This is the GitHub repository corresponding to the doctoral thesis [Spatial Optimization Techniques for School Redistricting](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/110433). In this thesis, optimization techniques have been developed for solving the school redistricitng problem. The techniques include 
- [clustering algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v34i09.7058) called GeoKMeans,
- [local-search framework](https://doi.org/10.1145/3347146.3359377) called REGAL,
- [memetic algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1145/3397536.3422265) called SPATIAL,
- [MCMC-based algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03703), and
- exact optimization methods.


The developement of these algorithms happened at different stages and used data for different school years. An attempt is made to consolidate the different algorithms for the most latest school year, i.e., 2020-21. As a result of this ongoing effort, we have presently made the following codes available:

- REGAL and SPATIAL at [SpatialPartitioning](https://github.com/subhodipbiswas/SpatialPartitioning)
- MCMC techniques at [SamplingbasedSchoolRedistricting](https://github.com/subhodipbiswas/SamplingbasedSchoolRedistricting)
- We will release the code for the clustering algorithm and the exact optimization method soon.

We encourage the research community to extend these algorithms to other similar redistricting problems
